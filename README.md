##What is it?

Other than a type of apple, Gala is a way to learn programming while having fun. Pit your army of robotic spaceships against another.

##What are the requirements?

We'll figure it out, but for now here are the versions of all the software we're running:

nodejs v0.6.1

npm modules: 

	express 0.7.1

	now 0.8.1

	ejs 0.7.1

A simple one-line installation of the npm modules:

`npm install express@0.7.1 now@0.8.1 ejs@0.7.1`
